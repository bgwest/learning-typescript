### Why am I learning typescript?
###### in no particular order...

- I am starting a new job that uses typescript
- I have wanted to learn/use typescript for awhile to improve my code
- I am helping a friend with a project and he uses typescript
- I want to get exposed to types in a language I am advanced in before jumping into new OOP lang

### package.json

You do not have to `npm i` if you have the needed typescript packages installed globally. I wanted the base packages to be notated though, for ease of use, if you were also new to typescript.

### testing

utilizing ts-jest for testing

https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-jest

### running code

either run in your favorite ide with the `ts-node` package or run `tsc file.ts` to convert to JS first and then you can run with node or in a browser.
